Running the Project
To run the project, provide the input file name in the command line. All input files should be located in the src folder, so for a file: mini-re-test.txt, the command line input should be "src/mini-re-test.txt".

Outputs
The output of any print statements go directly to the console. Any files created by a replace or recursivereplace command will be located in the src folder.
